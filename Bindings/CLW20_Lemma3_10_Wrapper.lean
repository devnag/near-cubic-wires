# The reject-short-witness wrapper: CLW20 Lemma 3.10 as printed feeds the import

`Bindings.CLW20_Lemma3_10` proves `CLW20_Lemma3_10_onWitnessLengthT → ProjectionPCPSource`. There the
time hypothesis is needed only for witnesses `y ∈ {0,1}^{T(n)}`. The printed lemma (CLW20 PDF
p.18, "Let M be an algorithm running in time T = T(n) ≥ n on inputs of the form (x, y) where
|x| = n") asks for time `T(n)` on EVERY input `(x, y)`. This module closes that gap. A verifier
`M` that halts within `T(n)` steps on witnesses of length `T(n)` is wrapped as `guard M`, which:

* halts within `T(n)` steps on EVERY witness (`guard_runsInTime`), and
* accepts a witness of length `T(n)` exactly when `M` does (`guard_accepts_iff`).

So the printed lemma applied to `(guard M, T)` is the witness-length version for `(M, T)`
(`clw20_lemma3_10_to_onWitnessLengthT`). With the adapter of `Bindings.CLW20_Lemma3_10` this gives
`clw20_lemma3_10_to_import : CLW20_Lemma3_10 → ProjectionPCPSource`.

## The wrapper

`guard M` runs `M` step for step, with one extra tape and one extra bit of control.

* The extra tape is the MIRROR. Its head moves exactly as the witness head does, and every step
  writes `true` under it. So a scanned mirror cell reads `false` exactly when the witness cell
  under the head is being visited for the first time. On a first visit the witness cell still
  holds its original content, even though `M` may write on its witness tape.
* Heads move by at most one cell, so first visits happen in increasing order. The index of a
  first-visited cell is the number of first visits so far. One control bit (the frontier
  parity) tracks whether it is even.
* The witness is framed (`frame y = true, y₁, true, y₂, …, false`), so the end of the witness is
  the first even cell holding `false`. When the guard scans that cell on a first visit, it
  REPLACES `M`'s step by a step into a halted, rejecting state.

Why the time bound stays exactly `T(n)`: pad a short witness `y` to `y' = y ++ 0…0` of length
`T(n)`. The two frames agree below cell `2|y|`. Until the head first reaches cell `2|y|`, the
guard on `y` does what `M` does on `y'` (`guard_run`). When the guard rejects at step `s`, `M` on
`y'` is not yet halted at step `s`, so `s + 1 ≤ T(n)`. On a witness of length exactly `T(n)`, a
run of `T(n)` steps never reaches cell `2T(n)`, so the guard never rejects there, and it accepts
exactly when `M` does. A witness longer than `T(n)` agrees with its first `T(n)` bits on every
cell a `T(n)`-step run can see (locality: `CloseoutFinalC10TapeLocality.runFrom_agree`).

This is the Tier 1 machine model (`Proof/Foundations/OrdinaryMachine.lean`, `Proof/Foundations/LocalBitMultitapeCore.lean`).
