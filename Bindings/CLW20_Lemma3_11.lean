# Binding: CLW20 Lemma 3.11 (the two-query PCPP, from [CW19, VW20]) → `PointwisePCPPSource`

Source PDF: `CLW20_Chen_Lyu_Williams_AE_Circuit_Lower_Bounds_ECCC_TR20-150.pdf`,
PDF page 18 (printed p.17), §3.5, verbatim:

> Lemma 3.11 ([CW19, VW20]). There are constants 0 < s_pcpp < c_pcpp < 1 and a polynomial-time
> transformation that, given a circuit D on n inputs of size m ≥ n, outputs a 2-SAT instance F on
> the variable set Y ∪ Z where |Y| ≤ poly(n), |Z| ≤ poly(m), and the following hold for all
> x ∈ {0, 1}^n:
> • If D(x) = 1, then F|Y=Enc(x) on variable set Z has a satisfying assignment Z_x such that at
>   least c_pcpp-fraction of the clauses are satisfied. Furthermore, there is a poly(m) time
>   algorithm that given x outputs Z_x.
> • If D(x) = 0, then there is no assignment to the Z variables in F|Y=Enc(x) satisfies more than
>   s_pcpp-fraction of the clauses.
> Moreover, the number of clauses in the 2-SAT instance F is a power of 2, and for each
> i ∈ [|Y|], Enc_i(x) is a parity function depending on at most n/2 bits of x.

## Deliverables

* `CLW20_Lemma3_11_asPrinted` : the sentence above for EVERY `n ≥ 1`.
  `clw20_lemma3_11_asPrinted_false` : it is FALSE. The proof uses `n = 1` and `D(x) = x₁`.
  Each `Enc_i` depends on at most `⌊1/2⌋ = 0` bits, so it is constant. Then `F|Y=Enc(x)` is the
  same instance for `x = 0` and `x = 1`, and completeness at `x = 1` contradicts soundness at
  `x = 0`, because `s < c`. `lemma3_11Core_false_at_one` proves this for EVERY output format, so
  the explicit-Enc reading below is false at `n = 1` as well.
* `CLW20_Lemma3_11` : the printed sentence with the ONLY change `n ≥ 2`.
  Support for `n ≥ 2`: CW19 Lemma 27 (`CW19_Chen_Williams_Stronger_Connections_via_PCPP.pdf`,
  PDF page 16) builds the code as "Enc(x) := Enc′(x1) ◦ Enc′(x2) ◦ Enc′(x3)", where x1, x2, x3 each
  have length "between ⌊n/3⌋ and ⌈n/3⌉". So each code bit is a parity of at most `⌈n/3⌉` input bits,
  and `⌈n/3⌉ ≤ ⌊n/2⌋` for every `n ≠ 1`, in particular for every `n ≥ 2` (`ceil_third_le_floor_half`). The printed Lemma 27 also
  says "at most n/2 bits", and at `n = 1` that fails in the same way.
* `CLW20_Lemma3_11_explicitEnc` : `CLW20_Lemma3_11` with ONE documented addition: the
  transformation's output word also lists the support of every `Enc_i`. That is the import's
  `pcppOutput` format. Every other clause is the same (both are `lemma3_11Core 2 _`, which differ
  only in the output-word argument).
  `clw20_lemma3_11_explicitEnc_to_import : CLW20_Lemma3_11_explicitEnc → PointwisePCPPSource`
  is PROVED.

## The gap between the literal and the import

The import's `constructor` must output `pcppOutput r (output r)`. The middle block of that word
is the support bitmap of every systematic coordinate. The printed lemma says that the
transformation "outputs a 2-SAT instance F". It never says that `Enc` is output or computable.
The supports cannot be recovered from `F`, from `Z_x`, or from the gap. So `CLW20_Lemma3_11`,
read literally, does not give the import. The textual basis for the one-field addition is:
* CLW20 PDF p.28 (printed p.27), §6.2.1: "Recall that Enc : {0, 1}^ℓ → {0, 1}^|Y| is the fixed
  F2-linear error correcting code used in Lemma 3.11." In the validity test PDF p.29 (printed p.28) says
  "Enc_s(x) depends on at most ℓ/2 bits (the moreover part of Lemma 3.11). We can then enumerate
  all these bits". So the paper's own algorithm knows the supports.
* CW19 Lemma 27, PDF p.16: "a constant-rate linear error correcting code ECC with minimum relative
  distance δ, an efficient encoder Enc and an efficient decoder Dec". A linear code with an
  efficient encoder has computable supports: `j ∈ supp(Enc_i)` iff `Enc(e_j)_i = 1`.
The arrow `CLW20_Lemma3_11 → CLW20_Lemma3_11_explicitEnc` needs an ordinary machine that also
writes the supports. That machine is not formalized here.

## Transcription choices (everything is in the literal's type or recorded here)

* The circuits are the repo's `BooleanCircuit n` (topological fan-in-two DAG). The size is
  `m = D.size`, the number of nodes. The domain is `n₀ ≤ n ≤ m`.
* The objects "F on Y ∪ Z" and `Enc` are `Instance n`. `F` has `|Y| + |Z|` variables, and the
  Y variables are the indices below `|Y|`. Its clauses are ORs of two literals (the repo's
  `TwoLiteralClause`). The clauses are indexed by `Fin (2 ^ clauseBits)`: this is the printed
  "the number of clauses … is a power of 2". "Enc_i(x) is a parity function" means that
  `Enc_i(x) = parityOn (encSupport i) x`, the XOR of the bits in the support. The parity depends
  on exactly the bits of its support, so "depending on at most n/2 bits" is
  `(encSupport i).card ≤ n / 2`. Here `/` is ℕ-division (floor). This is exact, not a choice,
  because a count of bits is an integer. The import has the same bound
  (`SourceInterfaces.PointwisePCPP.systematicSupportBound`). `Enc` may depend on `D`. That is
  the weakest reading, because the sentence does not fix `Enc` before `D`.
* "F|Y=Enc(x) … fraction of the clauses satisfied" is `Instance.fraction`. It sets the Y
  variables to `Enc(x)` and the Z variables to `z` (`Fin.addCases`), counts the satisfied
  clauses, and divides by `2 ^ clauseBits`. It is the same term as
  `PointwisePCPP.satisfiedFraction` (Proof/Foundations/SourceInterfaces.lean).
* Quantifier order as printed: first `∃ s c` with `0 < s < c < 1`, then the transformation
  (`F`, with its machine), then the polynomials. The polynomials are hidden constants, so they
  come after the transformation and may depend on it. That is the weakest reading. "poly(n)" is
  `K * (n + 1) ^ e` and "poly(m)" is `K * (m + 1) ^ e`, with a separate `K, e` for each clause.
* Tier 1 machine model. "a polynomial-time transformation that, given a circuit D, … outputs F"
  is an `OrdinaryWordFunction` over the circuits. It reads the circuit in the repo's canonical
  word `natWord n ++ (encodeBooleanCircuit D).bits` (the import's `pcppInput`), and it runs within
  `K * (m + n + 1) ^ e` steps (polynomial in the circuit parameters; `m ≥ n`). The output word is
  an argument of `lemma3_11Core`: `Instance.formulaWord` (F only, the literal) or
  `Instance.formulaEncWord` (F plus Enc's supports, the import's `pcppOutput` layout).
  "there is a poly(m) time algorithm that given x outputs Z_x" is ONE `OrdinaryWordFunction` on
  pairs `(D, x)`, within `K * (m + 1) ^ e` steps, whose output word is the bit list of `Z_x`.
  It is uniform in `D`. If the algorithm could depend on `D`, the clause would say nothing,
  because a machine built for one fixed `D` can compute any function of `x` by table lookup in
  linear time. CLW20 uses `Z_x` as efficiently computable, so the uniform reading is the
  faithful one. Tier 2 replaces only these two conjuncts.
* Proved, not assumed: the import's `clauseCountBound` (`2 ^ clauseBits ≤ poly(m)`) is not
  printed. It follows from the transformation's step bound. The output tape of an ordinary
  run holds at most `steps` cells (`output_length_le_budget`), and the output word lists
  `2 · 2^clauseBits` numbers, each at least one bit long (`two_pow_le_formulaEncWord_length`).
