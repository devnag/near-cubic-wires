# Binding: RS62 Theorem 4, eq. (3.14) → `PrimeThetaBoundContract`

Source PDF: `RS62_Rosser_Schoenfeld_Approximate_Formulas_Prime_Functions.pdf`
(its text layer is garbled; every quotation below was checked against the rendered page image).

* PDF page 1 (printed p.64), §2 Introduction:
  "Counting 2 as the first prime, we denote by π(x), ϑ(x), and ψ(x), respectively, the number
  of primes ≦ x, the logarithm of the product of all primes ≦ x, and the logarithm of the least
  common multiple of all positive integers ≦ x; if x < 2, we take π(x) = ϑ(x) = ψ(x) = 0. …
  Throughout, n shall denote a positive integer, p a prime, and x a real number."
* PDF page 3 (printed p.66): "(2.15) li(x) = Ei(log x)", with "(2.16)
  Ei(y) = lim_{ε→0+} {∫_{−∞}^{−ε} e^t dt/t + ∫_ε^y e^t dt/t}" and "(2.17)
  ∫_2^x dy/log y = li(x) − li(2)". (2.17) differentiates correctly only when `e^{log x} = x`,
  so `log` is the NATURAL logarithm: `Real.log`.
* PDF page 7 (printed p.70): "THEOREM 4. We have (3.14) x(1 − 1/(2 log x)) < ϑ(x) for
  563 ≦ x,".

Transcription choices: `x` is real (as the paper says); "the product of all primes ≤ x" is the
`finprod` over the set `{p : ℕ | p.Prime ∧ (p : ℝ) ≤ x}` (no floor appears in the literal); the
paper's convention "if x < 2, we take ϑ(x) = 0" is a consequence, proved as
`theta_eq_zero_of_lt_two` (empty product, `log 1 = 0`).

Self-contained: the step from (3.14) to the two-clause import is `rs62_prime_contract_iff`
below, which states (3.14) with the import's `chebyshevTheta`. This module adds `rs62_theta_eq` (the literal
`ϑ` IS `chebyshevTheta`, for every real `x`) and composes. It imports only
`Proof.Foundations.SourceInterfaces`.
