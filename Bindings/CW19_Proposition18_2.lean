Source PDF: `CW19_Chen_Williams_Stronger_Connections_via_PCPP.pdf`
(CCC 2019, pages numbered 19:1–19:43). The p.14 quotation was checked against the rendered
page image.

* PDF page 14 (printed 19:14), §2.1, verbatim:
  "Proposition 18. The following hold: … 2. THR ⊆ DOR ◦ ETHR [24]. (also see Appendix B) …
  Moreover, all the above have corresponding polynomial-time, deterministic constructions."
* PDF page 13 (printed 19:13), §2.1 "Notations for Circuit Classes", verbatim:
  "Let x ∈ {0, 1}^n. For w ∈ R^n and t ∈ R, we define THR_{w,t}(x) (the threshold function) to be
  the indicator function for the condition w · x ≥ t. Similarly, ETHR_{w,t}(x) (the exact
  threshold function) is the indicator function for the condition w · x = t. … It is known that,
  without loss of generality, the weights and thresholds are integers of absolute value at most
  2^{O(n log n)} [33, 7]." and, continuing onto PDF p.14: "We use DOR_n to denote the disjoint
  OR function, that is, an OR function with the promise that at most one input bit is true over
  all inputs."
* PDF page 14: "For two classes of functions like THR and MAJ, we use THR ◦ MAJ to denote the
  corresponding class of depth-two circuits."
* PDF page 41 (printed 19:41), Appendix B, Lemma 49, verbatim: "Let G be a THR gate on n bits,
  G(x) := [Σ_{i=1}^n w_i · x_i > T], such that all w_i's and T are integers from [−W, W] for some
  W ∈ N. Then G can be written as a DOR of O(n · log W) many ETHR gates, each with weights and
  threshold from [−Θ(W), Θ(W)]."

## Transcription choices

* **What is asserted.** Item 2 with the "Moreover" sentence: ONE deterministic polynomial-time
  algorithm that, given a THR gate `G`, outputs a DOR ◦ ETHR circuit computing the same Boolean
  function as `G`. `CW19_Proposition18_2` says: there is a construction `dor` sending every THR
  gate to a DOR ◦ ETHR circuit that computes it (`Computes`), and `dor` is computed by one fixed
  ordinary program in time polynomial in the length of the gate's description
  (`PolynomialTimeConstruction dor`).
* **Gate descriptions are integral, with the appendix's strict convention.** An algorithm reads a
  finite description, so the input gate has integer weights and threshold, exactly as in the
  cited construction (Appendix B, Lemma 49: `G(x) := [Σ w_i · x_i > T]` with integers). The strict
  `>` is the convention of that construction. §2.1 defines `THR` with `≥` and real parameters;
  for integers, `[w · x ≥ t] = [w · x > t − 1]`, so the class is the same.
  `nonStrict_integral_containment` below proves that the literal also covers every integral `≥`
  gate. The step from real to integral parameters is the "without loss of generality" remark of
  p.13 (CTW26 Lemma 3.2, bound separately in `Bindings.CTW26_Lemma3_2`). The import needs only the
  integral strict form.
* **ETHR gates are integral** (the construction outputs finite descriptions; Appendix B's ETHR
  gates have integer weights and thresholds), indicator of `w · x = t` on `x ∈ {0,1}^n`.
* **DOR ◦ ETHR circuit.** A top DOR gate whose inputs are ETHR gates `E_1, …, E_m` on the same
  `n` input bits, listed in order and with repetitions (a gate list, not a set). It is a legal
  DOR ◦ ETHR circuit when the DOR promise holds: on every `x ∈ {0,1}^n`, at most one `E_j(x)` is
  true. Its value is then the OR of the `E_j(x)`.
* **Every arity `n`, including `n = 0`.** The paper does not exclude `n = 0`. There the gate is a
  constant, and a DOR of zero ETHR gates (constant false) or of the single gate `[0 = 0]`
  (constant true) computes it, so the literal is true there.
* **"polynomial-time", hidden constants.** The weakest faithful reading: there EXIST constants
  `C` and `d` (chosen with the algorithm, uniform over all gates) such that the run on the
  description of `G` halts within `C · (ℓ + 1)^d` steps, where `ℓ` is the description length.
* **Tier 1 machine model.** The algorithmic clause is the separable structure
  `PolynomialTimeConstruction`, stated in the repo's model `RepairOrdinary.WordFunction`
  (`OrdinaryWordFunction`, `Proof/Foundations/OrdinaryMachine.lean`; the machine is
  `Proof/Foundations/LocalBitMultitapeCore.lean`: finite control, Boolean cells, local writes,
  unit head moves, one step per transition, deterministic). Descriptions are the conventional
  explicit binary words: `gateWord G` lists `n`, then `w_1, …, w_n`, then `T`; `circuitWord C`
  lists `m`, then for each ETHR gate its weights and its threshold. A natural number is written
  self-delimited (`natWord`, a unary length then the binary digits) and an integer as its sign bit
  then `natWord` of its absolute value (`intWord`). The input word is framed on tape 0 and the
  output appears on a fresh tape. Tier 2 replaces only this structure.
* **No sharp bounds are asserted.** The literal claims neither the gate count `O(n · log W)` nor
  the weight range `[−Θ(W), Θ(W)]` of Lemma 49, nor the range `[0, 2^{L+1} − 1]` of Lemma 48. The
  import needs only the qualitative polynomial-time construction. The printed sharp appendix
  claims contain errors and must not be imported. Checked against
  PDF pp.40–42:
  1. Lemma 48, p.41: "hence the sequence S is non-decreasing (and begins with 0)". The first term
     of `S` is `w^{(n,L)} · x = 2^{L−1} · w_{n,L} · x_n`, which need not be `0`.
  2. Lemma 48, p.41: "By division, T = 2^{b−1} · T_b + T_r, for some 0 ≤ T_r < 2^{b−1} and
     T_b > 0." The quotient `T_b = ⌊T / 2^{b−1}⌋` is `0` whenever `T < 2^{b−1}`.
  3. Lemma 48's gate `E^{(a,b)}(x) := [(2 · w^{(a,b)} · x) + x_a = 2^b · (T_b + 1) + 1]` has
     threshold up to `2^{L+1} + 1`, outside the printed range `[0, 2^{L+1} − 1]` (e.g. `n = L = 1`,
     `w_1 = T = 1`, `b = 1`: the threshold is `5 > 3`).
  4. Lemma 49, p.41: after negating the negative weights, `T̂ = T − Σ_{i∉S} w_i` can reach
     `(n + 1) · W`, so Lemma 48 applies with `2^L` of order `n · W`. The weights and thresholds are
     then of order `n · W`, not `Θ(W)`, and the count is `O(n · log(n W))`, not `O(n · log W)`
     (which is `0` at `W = 1`).
  None of this affects the qualitative claim: the construction, with these repairs, is a
  deterministic polynomial-time algorithm, and it is the one imported. The manuscript replays the
  quantitative argument locally where it needs sharp bounds.

## The adapter

`cw19_to_import` keeps the SAME program. It checks the conventions of `Proof/Foundations/Semantics.lean`
(`NormalizedThresholdGate.strictEval` is `threshold < Σ`, `ExactThresholdGate.eval` is `Σ = target`,
`ExactDecomposition` = `any` plus at most one accepting child), identifies the words
(`gateWord_eq`, `circuitWord_eq`), and enlarges the budget using the existing
`RepairOrdinary.DecompositionSource.thresholdWord_bound`
(`Proof/Circuits/DecompositionSourceBounds.lean`, `|thresholdWord g| ≤ 8 (n + bits + 1)`).
