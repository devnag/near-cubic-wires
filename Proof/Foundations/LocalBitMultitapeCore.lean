# Foundational finite-control local multitape bit machine

This lower-layer module is the source-facing machine model used by the
published Williams boundary and downstream loader.  A rule sees only the
current finite control state and the one scanned bit on each tape.  It writes
only those scanned cells and moves
each head by at most one position.  One rule application is one bit-TM step.

Unlike the earlier whole-configuration prototype, neither input loading nor an
arbitrary cost annotation is part of a transition.
