# Compact balanced CNF query codec

This low-level module sits below `Semantics`, so the fixed SAT opcode can
recognize the additive balanced query convention without changing the machine
instruction set.  The marker is an ordinary, constant-size CNF code whose
first clause is empty.  Hence the historical well-sized CNF convention rejects
it, while the singleton second clause carries a canonical balanced list of
ordinary clause codes.

/-! ## Level-2 (nested) balanced payload

The level-1 payload above is a single balanced list of clause codes.  A
scheduled producer cannot materialize that flat list without re-entering the
refuted geometric width cone of `OuterProofFormulaStreamGeometricDefect`, so
the additive convention below adds a second, disjointly tagged marker whose
payload is a balanced list of *chunk* codes, each chunk itself a balanced list
of canonical clause codes.  Decoding validates both levels and flattens only
afterwards, so no machine register ever holds the flat list.

The nested marker uses the `false` payload literal where the level-1 marker
uses `true`, so the two recognized regions are disjoint and both remain
old-malformed.  These definitions sit here, beside `decodeBalancedCNF`,
because `Proof.Foundations.Semantics` must see the nested decoder to dispatch `.sat`;
their theory is in `Proof.Foundations.NestedBalancedCNFCodec`. -/
