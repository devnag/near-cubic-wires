# Source-only recovery arity envelope

This module freezes the quantitative path shared by both headline recoveries.
Source instance `s` has length `2^(s+1)`, the outer proof is padded to the one
canonical width envelope, and the Case-2 oracle cap is one pairing clock.  The
two copy-count tiers differ only where the theorem statements differ:
inverse-polynomial advantage uses logarithmically many blocks, while fixed
advantage uses one constant number of blocks.

Every raw Case-2 XOR arity is bounded by a single smooth polynomial.  Case 1
and Case 2 can therefore be padded to that same arity before the target-length
selector runs; no branch-specific schedule or caller-selected growth function
is exposed.

/-! ### The same schedule at an arbitrary approximation radius

Every conclusion of the fixed-radius schedule above is reproduced here at an
arbitrary rational radius `delta`, under the two side conditions the imported
XOR contract already demands (`0 < delta` and `delta ≤ 1 / 2`).  The radius is
carried as a rational so that the copy counts stay computable; the schedule the
repaired seam selects is the instantiation at the validity constant of the
selected parameter package.  See the repair record above. -/

/-- Block length that halves the geometric factor at approximation radius
`delta`.  Since `Rat` is kept in lowest terms, `delta.den * delta = delta.num`
is at least one, so the denominator is always at least `1 / delta`: the block
grows like `1 / delta`, which is the whole quantitative price of the repair.
Reading the block off the denominator rather than through `Nat.ceil` keeps it
kernel-cheap, which the downstream witness-limit `rfl`s require. -/

/-! ## The copy schedule at a parametric radius

`Proof/PCP/VerifierThresholdSeam.lean` proves that the fixed radius `recoveryDelta = 1 / 4` cannot
be the radius the componentwise verifier charges: the seam's soundness reserve forces
`6 * zeta < 1 / 288`, while its completeness direction needs the joint clause budget
`2 * delta ≤ 6 * zeta`, i.e. `delta ≤ 3 * zeta`.

The geometric copy schedule is therefore defined above at an arbitrary rational radius `delta`
(`recoveryBlockOf`, `recoveryBlockOf_halves`, `inverseCopiesOf`, `fixedCopiesOf`,
`xorEpsilon_inverseCopiesOf_le`, `xorEpsilon_fixedCopiesOf_le`). The block length grows like
`1 / delta` (an elementary Bernoulli bound), and one extra block replaces the arithmetic
`1 / 2 - recoveryDelta = 1 / 4`, hence the `+ recoveryBlock` in `inverseCopies` and
`fixedCopies`, matched by the `+ recoveryBlock` in `inverseCopiesLinearCoefficient`.

No fixed literal radius can work. `executableParametersOfSource` is
`Classical.choice (existsExecutableSoundnessParameters source.gap)`, and its `zeta` is any
positive rational below `min (3 / 2) ((completeness - soundness) ^ 2 / 43200)`, with
`completeness` and `soundness` arbitrary reals of an arbitrary `UniformPointwisePCPPSource`. So
no positive literal `c` admits a proof of `c ≤ 3 * zeta`, and the radius must be a function of
the selected package: `VerifierThresholdSeam.repairedRecoveryDelta`.

The published schedule below is the generic schedule at `repairedDeltaValue pcppSource`, the
validity constant of the parameter package the componentwise verifier selects for the scheduled
pointwise-PCPP source, so the completeness seam closes at the radius the schedule uses.
`recoveryBlock`, `inverseCopies`, `fixedCopies` and `inverseCopiesLinearCoefficient` take the
`pcppSource` argument; `inverseRawCoreArity`, `fixedRawCoreArity`,
`inverseScheduledRawCoreArity`, `inverseCoreEnvelope` and `fixedCoreEnvelope` already receive it.
`ExecutableSoundnessParameters` (the threshold, `zeta`, the outer error, the estimation error and
both reserves) is unchanged. The admissibility conditions of the imported XOR contract,
`0 ≤ delta` and `delta < 1 / 2`, are proved at this radius in `VerifierThresholdSeam.§9`.

The fixed literal is kept below as `recoveryDelta`, with no schedule depending on it, because it
is the object of the refutation in `VerifierThresholdSeam.§7`;
`repairedDelta_ne_recoveryDelta` records that the two radii differ. -/

/-! ### The repaired approximation radius

The radius the schedule runs at is the validity constant of the parameter
package the componentwise verifier selects for the scheduled pointwise-PCPP
source.  It is choice-opaque: the only facts available about it are its
positivity and the soundness-reserve bound re-proved here. -/
