# The linearity expansion of the aggregate clause mean

`AggregateSemanticStage` closes the corrected semantic stage down to one
obligation, `AggregateEstimateAccurate`: the machine must produce a number
within `estimationError` of

```text
mu = E_{i,u} F_i(T(u))
```

where `F_i` is the manuscript's degree-two arithmetization of PCPP clause `i`
and `T(u)` is the proof vector recovered from the guessed legal circuit sum at
PCPP input `u`.  This module builds the bridge from the supplier estimator's
per-request conjunction probabilities to that one number, which is Appendix
C.10's sentence "the machine estimates `mu` **by expanding it into AND-four
supplier calls**".

## §0 What the expansion produces

Three structures compose, and each of them is *linear*:

* the guessed sum is `D = sum_a alpha_a C_a`, linear in its atoms;
* fixing a clause address and a side is a **literal restriction** of every
  atom (`SliceRestricts` below), so on each occurrence slice the guess is one
  linear polynomial in circuits of the supplier's own family at arity `n`;
* the recovered proof coordinate is the **occurrence-fibre average** of the
  signed slice readings, again linear.

Only the clause polynomial `L + R - L*R` is nonlinear, and it is nonlinear of
degree exactly two.  Consequently **every** monomial of the expansion carries
at most two restricted atoms: the conjunctions that arise are the empty
conjunction (the constant, `conjunctionProbability evaluate []` = 1),
singletons `[C]`, and pairs `[C, C']`.  All three are inside the supplier's
`circuits.length <= 4` ABI, so no shape the expansion produces is outside what
`SharedNormalizedEstimator` can express.  The four-atom conjunctions of the
manuscript come from the *validity* side (`T^2 (1-T)^2`), which the seam
charges separately; the estimated clause mean itself never needs more than a
pair.

## §1 The bookkeeping

`ComponentwisePolynomial` already owns the monomial calculus: `clausePolynomial`
is the degree-two clause, `literalPolynomial` is the sign, `CircuitPolynomial.mul`
appends factor lists, and `estimatedMean_error_le` is the componentwise error
ledger.  Only one constructor is missing — a *finite* sum of polynomials, needed
by the occurrence fibre and by the clause-index average — and §1 supplies it.

## §2 The expansion

`aggregateClausePolynomial` is the composite, and
`aggregateClauseMean_eq_sum_conjunctionProbability` is the exact algebraic
identity: the aggregate clause mean *is* the coefficient-weighted sum of
conjunction probabilities of restricted atom lists of length at most two.

## §3 The coefficient mass

`clauseMassCap` is the manuscript's `Lambda_0`: with per-slice coefficient mass
at most `Lambda`, the aggregate expansion has coefficient mass at most
`(2 + Lambda)^2 + 2 * (2 + Lambda)`.  The two additive `1`s are the two signs —
the occurrence table stores the *signed* literal value, and the clause
polynomial re-applies the sign — and the square is the single product.  In the
manuscript's notation `Lambda_0 <= 4 * augmented^2 + 4 * augmented`, comfortably
inside the published `augmented^4`.

## §4 The recombination and the numeric dial

`aggregateEstimate_error_le_of_expansion` is `componentwise_real_error` at
`error := rows.failure`, `mass := Lambda_0`;
`aggregate_estimatedMean_error_le` is its instance at the concrete expansion.
`massCap_advantage_le_estimationError` is the numeric dial: at the published
request `D > 4R + 10` of Appendix C.3/A.8, the inverse-polynomial supplier
advantage times `Lambda_0(q)` is eventually below any fixed positive
`estimationError`.

## §5 The stage

`aggregateEstimateAccurate_of_expansion` discharges
`AggregateSemanticStage.AggregateEstimateAccurate`, and the two stage-side
corollaries put the completeness comparison and the soundness contradiction
each behind one named hypothesis about the executed supplier aggregation.
