/-! ## §1 One uniform domination judgement -/

/-- **The domination judgement.**  `PolyBounded value measure coefficient
degree` says the charge `value` is dominated by the polynomial budget of
`coefficient` and `degree` at `measure`.  It is definitionally the machine's
own `polynomialBudget` inequality, so nothing is lost transporting a spine
fact into a premise of `ExecutableRecoveryMachine`. -/

/-- **The only degree-raising rule.**  A charge repeated once per element of a
counted collection multiplies the two coefficients and *adds* the two degrees.
Every multiplication in the cone is of this shape — a count, a width, an arity
or an index against a per-element charge — never a decoded magnitude. -/

/-! ## §2 The linker and call-combinator algebra

Every composite fuel definition in the validator's cone is one of the eight
shapes below.  Each is discharged once, from §1, so a spine walk never has to
re-derive a linker charge. -/

/-- Scaling by a closed repetition count keeps the degree. -/

/-! ## §4 The width of the frozen limits record

The width ledger of §3 exposes exactly one ingredient that is not a charge of
an executable stage: the validator's structural prefix carries
`encodeRecoveryWitnessLimits limits` through its handoff, so its register width
is bounded only once the encoded policy record is.  This section closes that
for the computable limits family, whose every field is explicit arithmetic in
the frozen amplifier numerals, the copy bound and the arity. -/

/-! ### The serialized policy record -/

/-! ### The computable limits family

Every field of `computableXorRecoveryWitnessLimits` is explicit arithmetic in
the four frozen profile numerals, the copy bound and the arity, so the width
certificate above is available unconditionally. -/

/-! ## §5 The machine's two validator premises

The machine charges at `recoveryVerifierDegree = 4`.  §3 turns a stage-level
envelope of any degree `d` into a validator-level envelope of degree `d`; the
numeral is then raised to `4` by `PolyBounded.degree_mono`, which is legal for
every `d ≤ 4` and forces a reported degree lift for any `d > 4`. -/
