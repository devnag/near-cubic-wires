/-!
The native denominator width is polynomial in native q, before choosing the
schedule exponent. One polynomial witness then fixes an exponent and finite
onset for the existing entryWidthSchedule. No restriction to the old soundness
cutoff, no physical runtime assertion, and no enlarged resource budget.
