/-! **Decision tail, stage 1 — the two facts the docking rests on.**

Paper C.10 (~4103): the machine passes validity only if the first estimated
average is at most `2*zeta` and every second moment at most `1+zeta`, and
accepts only if `mu~ >= theta_acc` (C.10.1). The physical comparators already
exist (`validity_mean_run`, `validity_moment_run`, `midpoint_run`); they read
their operands as SEPARATE framed binary words. The worker delivers each phase's
estimate as ONE record word. Two facts bridge them:

1. `recordWord_split` -- a record word is its six framed fields in order, so
   field `k` sits at a computable cursor and `Field.copy_run` can lift it out.
2. `frame_resize_binary` -- `ClockNormalize` widens a `binary` word exactly, so
   the record's `width W` operands become the comparator's `width (width W)`
   operands with no new stage.

Nothing here touches a tape; it is what makes the tape work in stage 2 routine. -/

/-- **Widening is exact.** For `p < 2^W` and `W ≤ w`, resizing the `W`-bit word
of `p` to `w` bits gives the `w`-bit word of `p`. This is what lets one
`normalize_run` feed the comparator from the record. -/
