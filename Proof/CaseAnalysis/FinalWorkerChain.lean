/-! # W1 -- the C.10 worker chain, anchored at the PCPP clause addresses

Paper C.10 (paper.tex 4098-4110):

> The weak machine estimates `E_{i,j,u} P_ij` and every `E_u Q_ij`.  **All
> expressions have degree at most four in the guessed sums.** ... Expanding
> `(Enc_s - T_ij)^2` then uses only constants, carried atoms, and conjunctions

Paper C.10.1 (paper.tex 4103):

> estimates `mu = E_{i,u} F_i(u)` **by expanding it into AND-four supplier
> calls**.

This module realizes those two sentences physically.  The machine ranges over
PCPP clause addresses `i : Fin (2 ^ pcpp.clauseBits)` -- P3a's site list -- and
emits, per address, **one record per monomial of that address's site
polynomial**; each such record is one AND-four supplier call, because the
monomial's factor list has length at most four by the degree index of
`CircuitPolynomial Atom 4` (`phasePolynomial_factors_length_le_four`).  The
`u`-average never appears as an enumeration: it sits inside
`conjunctionProbability`, which is what the supplier answers.

Three things are proved here.

* **The call list of the phase is the concatenation of the call lists of the
  clause addresses** (`calls_of_clauseAddresses`).  This is the physical form
  of "site list = PCPP clause address, and nothing else".
* **The machine's exact signed-rational fold of those calls IS the paper's
  estimated mean** (`folded_value_eq_estimatedMean`).  This is C.10.1's
  "expanding it into AND-four supplier calls", as an identity between the
  corpus's own `CompetitorSumFold.folded` and `CircuitPolynomial.estimatedMean`.
* **The gated worker realizes one phase** (`worker_realizes`).  The length gate
  of P4 is the worker's front; the estimator body is docked inside it; the
  budget is a function of the input length alone.

The one obligation this module does NOT discharge is `EstimatorBody`: the
physical receipt that the docked estimator body, started at the gate's exit on
the verifier's own tapes, leaves the record word of that fold on its output
port.  That structure is the exact junction, stated so that every field of it
is named.

/-- **The worker.**  P4's length gate is its front: the gate counts the frozen

otherwise hands the estimator body the verifier's own tapes with every head at

/-- **The budget is a function of the input length alone.**  The gate costs
`4*C+3` and the body is charged `fuel len`; neither term mentions the witness
string, which is what `Weak.StepAtInputs` requires of a `budget : ℕ → ℕ`. -/
