/-! Paper C.10: the ordinary worker is a *deterministic* machine that always
halts inside its polynomial fuel. Nothing in the paper asks the worker to be
partial, and nothing asks its decided predicate to be supplied from outside.

`ClosureAt.meaning` is a field of the closure, so the consumer is free to pin
it. Pinning it to exactly what the worker decides turns `AllInputRun` -- which
asks for a run *and* an exact characterisation -- into pure totality, because
`run` is a function: the run it produces is the only run there is.

This is a relocation of content, never an assumption. The physical obligations
do not disappear; they move to `sound` and to the two `Completeness` fields,
which are the places paper C.10 and C.12 put them. -/
