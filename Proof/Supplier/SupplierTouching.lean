# Touching-set selection

This module proves the exact finite averaging bound behind `TouchingSelect`.
Support occurrences are indexed by a finite type, so duplicate supports remain
distinct charges.  Among the `K`-subsets of `Fin q`, one selection touches at
most the incidence-average: `q * touched ≤ K * totalSupportMass`.
